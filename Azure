Services
Migration
VM - 1.create migration project, Install migrate collecter tool and discover the onpremises VMs
     2. Create Assesment, Create Group and add vms into that group, check Azure readiness(Edit properties,Export assessment as excel)
     3 Storage account, virtual network, recovery Services vault(Preparing to recieve replication data)
     4 in Recovery service vault, -> site recovery -> 1. prepare Infrastructure 
                                                      2. Deployment Planing (Which is already done) 
                                                      3 Source 
                                                      4 Target 
                                                      5 replication settings(replicaton policy)
     5 replicate selected VMs and its properties in specific virtual network
     6 crating recovery plan to automate the steps to bring the server up and running simulataniously or customize the steps 
     7 Test failover and verfy the componets assigned by Azure. Make the changes if needed.

Storage
Blob
     Page blob - Blobcan upto 8 TB in size. Vms use this blob for OS and Data disks
     Block blob - ideally for documents and media files. 50000 blocks * 100M(each)=4.75TB
     Append blob -Similar like Block blob. Optimzed with append operations,so they can used for logging scenarios.50000block*4mb(each)=195 GB
File - Replace or complement for on-premise file server
Tables -Azure Table storage is a service that stores structured NoSQL data in the cloud, providing a key/attribute store with a schemaless design
queues 
     Creating a backlog of work to process asynchronously
     Passing messages from an Azure web role to an Azure worker role
Disks
     Standard- HDD, LRS
     Premium- SSD, GRS, RA-GRS
     Unmanged disks- Unmanaged disks are the traditional type of disks that have been used by VMs. 
                     With these, you create your own storage account and specify that storage account when you create the disk.
                            -There is a chance to missout scalabality targets like IO operations  
     Managed Disks - handles the storage account creation/management in the background for you
                        and ensures that you do not have to worry about the scalability limits of the storage account

Azure Roles 
     (https://yourstory.com/2012/02/step-by-step-guide-to-create-first-windows-azure-application/)
     Web role - Web Role takes HTTP input and Process it. It gives output as HTTP Response. It takes input from user via a user interface.
     Worker role - Worker Role runs in the background. It is used to perform some background task. It does not take input from user. It takes input from Azure Storage or web Role.
